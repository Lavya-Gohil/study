## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Ignoring NCERT**: Biggest mistake - 60% paper is NCERT
2. **Using JEE books**: Too advanced for NEET
3. **Not practicing numericals**: NEET has many numerical questions
4. **Ignoring units**: Always check units in answers
5. **Poor time management**: Practice time-bound tests

## 📖 Code-wise Papers Importance

### Why Multiple Codes?
- NEET uses multiple code sets (E, F, G, H series)
- Same 50 questions, different order
- Prevents copying

### For Practice
- Solve one code completely
- No need to solve all codes (same questions)
- Focus on understanding concepts, not memorizing
