   - 10-15 questions are diagram-based
   - Label all parts
   - Understand functions

3. **Neglecting Botany**
   - Many students focus only on Zoology
   - Botany equally important (180 marks!)

4. **Not Revising Regularly**
   - Biology needs regular revision
   - Facts forgotten easily
   - Daily revision is must

5. **Using Too Many Books**
   - NCERT is sufficient
   - Too many books create confusion
   - Stick to NCERT + one reference maximum

6. **Ignoring Previous Year Papers**
   - Questions repeat (concepts, not exact)
   - Shows important topics
   - Must solve 2015-2024 papers
